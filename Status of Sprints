Working with Team G0 was a smooth and rewarding experience. Our communication was consistently strong, and each member brought
a unique way of thinking—whether it was from the user’s perspective, focusing on the code, planning ahead, or breaking problems into clear sections. 
This diversity of thought helped us generate creative solutions and made collaboration engaging.

What didn’t work as well was our tendency to jump ahead and spend too much time thinking about how cool the finished product and 
future features could be, rather than making sure the base functionality was solid first. For the future, we need to focus on breaking 
the project into smaller, manageable pieces, completing those step by step, and then layering in the advanced features once the foundation is secure.
